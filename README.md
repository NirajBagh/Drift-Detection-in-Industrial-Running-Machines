# Drift-Detection-in-Industrial-Running-Machines
Drift detection in industrial machines is crucial for several reasons, primarily to ensure the efficient operation, reliability, and safety of the equipment. Drift detection helps in identifying abnormal patterns or deviations in machine behavior (e.g., vibration, temperature, or power consumption). Early detection allows operators to perform preventive maintenance, reducing downtime and preventing catastrophic failures. Continuous monitoring and detecting changes in machine performance can signal when machinery is not operating at optimal efficiency. Adjustments can then be made to improve performance, saving energy and resources. Early detection of changes in machine performance ensures that corrective actions are taken before a machine failure occurs, minimizing production interruptions.
This notebook is intended to illustrate the change detection of industrial machinery by walking through a real life dataset of bearing vibration data.
